To create a scalable service, I designed the physical product, packaging and production process around efficient fulfilment. In terms of the web experience, I was responsible for the UX and leading the design and development teams.

Product decisions were driven by user feedback, data analysis, A/B testing and “concierge” style guerrilla experiments of new features.

In summer 2012 I redesigned the site to be mobile optimise. Beginning with paper prototypes I sought to test ways of stripping back the pages to work responsively. The result was a significant increase in mobile conversions and a 30% increase in sales.

In addition, I was also responsbile for non-technical aspects of business, from community management and customer support to marketing and expanding the team.
