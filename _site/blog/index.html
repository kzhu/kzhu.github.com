	<h2>My First Exit</h2>
	</a>
<div>02-07-2013</div>
<p><p>Last Sunday, it was announced that the service I had created, <a href="http://stickygram.com">StickyGram</a>, was acquired by <a href="http://mintdigital.com/blog/photobox_stickygram">PhotoBox</a>. The official announcement covers the specifics of the deal and the sentiments of the team. These are a few of my own reflections.</p>

<p>For me, the deal marked a positive end to an extraordinary personal journey that started more than two years ago. This was my first real business. I had dabbled with ideas before, but I never had the fortitude or courage to see any of them through. From the start, I made a conscious decision to do this for the learning and not the &quot;exit&quot;. Perhaps that&#39;s what made it different.</p>

<h4>Messing with magnets</h4>

<p>It began with a fairly trivial idea; turn people&#39;s Instagram images into fridge magnets. Over time, we grew it into a service that reached all around the world. In between, there was excitment, doubt, disappointment and elation. But mostly there was grind. No &quot;hockey stick&quot; growth, just small victories we fought for and earned each day. Somedays, we messed up. We couldn&#39;t always give 100%. I probably beat myself up too much for it.</p>

<p>In many ways, we were lucky. The Instagram team built an incredible product. Without their vision and focused execution there wouldn&#39;t be a vibrant community sharing their lives in images. Also, we didn&#39;t need outside investors. My employers, <a href="http://mintdigital.com">Mint Digital</a>, were willing to take a gamble and allowed me to start it from within the agency. I am tremendously grateful to have been given the resources, mentoring and autonomy to follow my instincts.</p>

<h4>Barely viable to mobile optimised</h4>

<p>There were dark moments. I remember 3am on our first Christmas eve, staring down an inbox full of customers who hadn&#39;t received their orders, knowing each one was a gift that would go unfulfilled. Fortunately, startups are a team sport and we had a <a href="http://mintdigital.com/people">stellar crew</a>. I&#39;m thankful for everyone at Mint for pitching in. Your encouragement and support made the challenges much less frightening. In particular I would like to thank the core team, <a href="http://twitter.com/philnash">Phil</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/pavedwithgold">Kaye</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/mattboxs">Matt</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/eellson">Ed</a>. You deserve a huge chunk of credit for contributing so much to the success of StickyGram. Thank you for trusting me, even when I doubted myself.</p>

<h4>Getting the hang of packaging design</h4>

<p>One of our biggest challenges was finding someone to make the magnets. I am tremendously grateful to our manufacturers for their help. You guys took a chance on our idea when everyone else said it couldn&#39;t be done. Without your ingenuity and tireless attention to quality, StickyGram would have never delighted so many individuals around the world.</p>

<p>We started out by putting nothing more than a few pictures and words on a landing page. But that was enough for the Internet to echo back. It was a modest response, but to us it was deafening. Thank you to all our early supporters and collaborators. Even though we were rough round the edges, you still trusted us with your pictures and endorsement. Your tweets, feedback and patience helped guide us and built the confidence that kept us going.</p>

<p>Most of all I&#39;d like to thank everyone who bought StickyGrams. Out of all the services vying for your attention and money, you chose us. I hope we lived up to your expectations. I&#39;d especially like to thank those of you who took the time to write to us. You made a little office in London very happy with stories of how much delight our product brought you.</p>

<p>Looking back, I am still amazed at what we achieved. We took a simple idea and put it into the hands of people around the world. With PhotoBox&#39;s strong track record in customised gifts, I have no doubt they&#39;ll improve upon what we started and introduce many more people to StickyGram. As for Mint, a lot has been said about agencies creating businesses. Few have followed through and even fewer have seen any meaningful returns. I&#39;d like to write about this more in the future. For now, Mint are trailblazing. I&#39;m happy to have been a part of it and look forward to see where they take it. </p>

<p>As for me, I left StickyGram and Mint behind in November last year to see what else I can create. Business was better than ever and I was sure the team could operate without me. I had set out to earn experience and confidence, and with StickyGram, I gained that and more. </p>

<p>I will be moving to San Francisco this autumn. I&#39;m excited for the next part of my journey.</p>

	<h2>Visualising Pi</h2>
	</a>
<div>28-06-2013</div>
<p><p>As part of my plan to get more fluent with prototyping in code, I decided to build a 3D, animated visualisation of Pi using <a href="http://processingjs.org">Processing.JS</a>. The result is here:
<code>
    <canvas id="pi_vis" data-processing-sources="files/sphere_master_v3.pde" style="image-rendering: -webkit-optimize-contrast !important;"></canvas>
</code></p>

<p><em>Currently having some issues displaying this in all browsers. If anyone can shed some light on this I&#39;d be most appreciative</em></p>

<p>Pi is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi">enigmatic concept</a>. On the one hand we can look at it simply as the ratio between the diameter of a circle and its circumference. On the other its an infinitely long number that, if proven to be randomly distributed, theoreticallys contain <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/216343/does-pi-contain-all-possible-number-combinations">all possible information in the universe</a>. For the purposes of this hack I decided to choose the former interpretation.</p>

<p>To begin with I generated a long string of Pi digits using <a href="http://www.craig-wood.com/nick/articles/pi-machin/">Machin&#39;s formula</a>. Fortunately, I could pull the bulk of the implementation from this <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/rmi/client.html">tutorial</a>. I then displayed these digits as circles of varying size distributed on the surface of a sphere. This was simply a matter of plotting spherical polar coordinates in 3D space. Finally, I used panned the camera angle to give the appearance of movement.</p>

<p>Main Lesson learnt; <strong>Processing Is A Bit Pants</strong>. There is no easy way to debug you program. Switching between Processing and ProcessingJS results in various parts breaking. Don&#39;t ge me wrong, it allowed me to get up and running very fast. I am happy with the end result, however, in future I will probably first attempt to use a modern language such as Python.</p>

	<h2>Hello World</h2>
	</a>
<div>06-06-2013</div>
<p><p>This is my first post on my brand new blog. It&#39;s been 3 years since I last attempted to publish anything on the web. For a while at least, the writing here will be confusing and at best awkward. Bear with me.</p>

<p>I created this blog as an outlet for my ideas and projects. I&#39;m a firm believer in the importance of putting what you create into the world. Without the fear of scrutiny our creations rarely receive the attention they need to fulfill their ambition. It also serves as a convenient stopping point from all the tweaking.</p>

<p>At the moment I&#39;ve been learning to code. Simple things. My goal is not to become a paid developer. I did that once. I wasn&#39;t very good. This time around I want to get a better understanding of how digital products are built. Hopefully these skills will enhance my design work, let me build some fun hacks and at the very least look less gormless when someone starts talking about the DOM or Backbone.</p>

<p>The first project I have to showcase is this blog. I built this using the wonderfully light weight <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/">Jekyll-Bootstrap</a> framework hosted on <a href="http://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>. It was a bit tricky getting everything set up but the tutorials made it relatively painfree.</p>

<p>Rather than use a template as a starting point, I decided to code the html and css from scratch. I also set myself the additional challenge of making it a responsive site so that it works across different devices. The tutorials at <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a> made is really straight forward even if the style of video made me cringe.</p>

<p>In addition, I got to grips with using <a href="http:/github.com">Github</a> for my version control and used <a href="http://icomoon.io/">IcoMoon</a> to create the font icons in the top bar.</p>

<p>Whilst it&#39;s not the most inventive design I&#39;m pretty satisfied with what I&#39;m starting with. There will be ongoing improvements as I test different approaches and techniques.</p>
