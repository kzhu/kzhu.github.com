	<h2>Does Life End at 35?</h2>

<div>19-10-2013</div>
<p><p>Do you sometimes lie awake worrying that you aren&#39;t succeeding fast enough? Are you tortured by your lack of a million dollar business, critically acclaimed book, groundbreaking patents or iron-man medal? Does it torture you that your younger peers seem to be all streaking past you in the game of life? Take a deep breath. My 92 year old grandpa has some advice for you.</p>

<h4>Now listen up</h4>
</div>

<p>I visited him in Beijing recently. We were taking a stroll after dinner. I was pestering him for details about his accomplished career, looking for tidbits that might help my own. What was he like at my age? How did he work? Is there a secret a routine? He stops me mid-sentence &quot;You know, my career only really took off after I turned 58&quot;. </p>

<p>Hang on, what? </p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I&#39;d say the 10 years between my 60s and 70s were my busiest&quot;. </p>

<p>I was floored. Here is a man who helped revolutionise medical technology and he did it in his twilight years.</p>

<h4>Serving in WW2</h4>
</div>

<p>It began in 1976, with the death of Chairman Mao. Under his rule, China experienced decades of hardship. Academia was heavily restricted and the country had become technologically isolated. Prior to this, my grandpa had lived through the invasion, civil war and famine. With Mao out of the picture, the new leadership were desperate for reform. In a push to kickstart research, the government reached out to academics all over the country. My grandpa was one of them.</p>

<p>Having only been allowed to complete his undergraduate degree, he spent decades doing whatever research and teaching came his way. Eventually - and this is the key word- he worked his way up to become an associate professor in electrical engineering at a respected university. In 1977, despite being close to retirement, he seized upon his new professional freedom. In front of China&#39;s senior academics and officials, he presented a convincing proposal to explore the emerging field of Biomedical Engineering, a term only recently coined in the West. Over the next decade, he spearheaded research and collaborations that would make technology such as CT, ultrasound and CAT scans a pervasive part of Chinese healthcare. Even after retirement, he was still mentoring PhD students well into his 70s.

<h4> Studious young man </h4>
</div></p>

<p>My grandpa&#39;s story made me reflect upon the worship of youthful achievement and our drive to get it all so early in life. I, like many other insecure overachievers, feel an urgency to do big things. Deep down I know this anxiety is root in fear. That I&#39;m not actually any good. That I will waste my shot at life and be a disappointment. So I strive for a quick success because I need to validate my worth. After that I can relax and everything will be plain sailing. Right? Instead, this warped expectation more often leads me to behave in a manner that&#39;s unsustainable and counterproductive. </p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to forget that our careers extend for decades beyond our 20s and 30s. The truth is significant works usually take a long time. Whether it&#39;s business, academia or the arts, most of the contributions made have been the result of many years of toil. It&#39;s just that we hear of the young overnight success because that&#39;s a more attractive narrative. Even then, those rare few who achieve a lot early in life do not simply stop. The race doesn&#39;t end with the win.</p>

<p>My grandpa had no choice but to wait a long time for his opportunity. It&#39;s likely he would have achieved even more had be moved to the West. However, had he missed his moment, I dare say he would still have had a fulfilling life. Without the acclaim and recognition he&#39;d still be the jovial, curious and industrious man I love. </p>

<h4> Jacking wifi from the hotel over the road </h4>
</div>

<p>His advice to me: Don&#39;t be in so much of a rush. Be easier on yourself. Comparing yourself to what others are doing is a waste of time. He also adds an old Chinese saying &quot;大器晚成&quot; - A big construction is always completed late.</p>

<p>With this in mind, I feel more positive about entering my third decade. There&#39;s still loads I want do and I  feel good about figuring out what success means to me, a topic which I will leave for another article. As always, I look to my grandfather for inspiration. He recently Skyped me about co-patenting  a new method of microwave cooking. I think he was only semi-joking.</p>

<p>If this has provoked any ideas of your own I&#39;d love to hear from you @kzhu</p>

	<h2>My First Exit</h2>
	</a>
<div>02-07-2013</div>
<p><p>Last Sunday, it was announced that the service I had created, <a href="http://stickygram.com">StickyGram</a>, was acquired by <a href="http://mintdigital.com/blog/photobox_stickygram">PhotoBox</a>. The official announcement covers the specifics of the deal and the sentiments of the team. These are a few of my own reflections.</p>

<p>For me, the deal marked a positive end to an extraordinary personal journey that started more than two years ago. This was my first real business. I had dabbled with ideas before, but I never had the fortitude or courage to see any of them through. From the start, I made a conscious decision to do this for the learning and not the &quot;exit&quot;. Perhaps that&#39;s what made it different.</p>

<h4>Messing with magnets</h4>

<p>It began with a fairly trivial idea; turn people&#39;s Instagram images into fridge magnets. Over time, we grew it into a service that reached all around the world. In between, there was excitment, doubt, disappointment and elation. But mostly there was grind. No &quot;hockey stick&quot; growth, just small victories we fought for and earned each day. Somedays, we messed up. We couldn&#39;t always give 100%. I probably beat myself up too much for it.</p>

<p>In many ways, we were lucky. The Instagram team built an incredible product. Without their vision and focused execution there wouldn&#39;t be a vibrant community sharing their lives in images. Also, we didn&#39;t need outside investors. My employers, <a href="http://mintdigital.com">Mint Digital</a>, were willing to take a gamble and allowed me to start it from within the agency. I am tremendously grateful to have been given the resources, mentoring and autonomy to follow my instincts.</p>

<h4>Barely viable to mobile optimised</h4>

<p>There were dark moments. I remember 3am on our first Christmas eve, staring down an inbox full of customers who hadn&#39;t received their orders, knowing each one was a gift that would go unfulfilled. Fortunately, startups are a team sport and we had a <a href="http://mintdigital.com/people">stellar crew</a>. I&#39;m thankful for everyone at Mint for pitching in. Your encouragement and support made the challenges much less frightening. In particular I would like to thank the core team, <a href="http://twitter.com/philnash">Phil</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/pavedwithgold">Kaye</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/mattboxs">Matt</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/eellson">Ed</a>. You deserve a huge chunk of credit for contributing so much to the success of StickyGram. Thank you for trusting me, even when I doubted myself.</p>

<h4>Getting the hang of packaging design</h4>

<p>One of our biggest challenges was finding someone to make the magnets. I am tremendously grateful to our manufacturers for their help. You guys took a chance on our idea when everyone else said it couldn&#39;t be done. Without your ingenuity and tireless attention to quality, StickyGram would have never delighted so many individuals around the world.</p>

<p>We started out by putting nothing more than a few pictures and words on a landing page. But that was enough for the Internet to echo back. It was a modest response, but to us it was deafening. Thank you to all our early supporters and collaborators. Even though we were rough round the edges, you still trusted us with your pictures and endorsement. Your tweets, feedback and patience helped guide us and built the confidence that kept us going.</p>

<p>Most of all I&#39;d like to thank everyone who bought StickyGrams. Out of all the services vying for your attention and money, you chose us. I hope we lived up to your expectations. I&#39;d especially like to thank those of you who took the time to write to us. You made a little office in London very happy with stories of how much delight our product brought you.</p>

<p>Looking back, I am still amazed at what we achieved. We took a simple idea and put it into the hands of people around the world. With PhotoBox&#39;s strong track record in customised gifts, I have no doubt they&#39;ll improve upon what we started and introduce many more people to StickyGram. As for Mint, a lot has been said about agencies creating businesses. Few have followed through and even fewer have seen any meaningful returns. I&#39;d like to write about this more in the future. For now, Mint are trailblazing. I&#39;m happy to have been a part of it and look forward to see where they take it. </p>

<p>As for me, I left StickyGram and Mint behind in November last year to see what else I can create. Business was better than ever and I was sure the team could operate without me. I had set out to earn experience and confidence, and with StickyGram, I gained that and more. </p>

<p>I will be moving to San Francisco this autumn. I&#39;m excited for the next part of my journey.</p>

	<h2>Visualising Pi</h2>
	</a>
<div>28-06-2013</div>
<p><p>As part of my plan to get more fluent with prototyping in code, I decided to build a 3D, animated visualisation of Pi using <a href="http://processingjs.org">Processing.JS</a>. The result is here:
<code>
    <canvas id="pi_vis" data-processing-sources="files/sphere_master_v3.pde" style="image-rendering: -webkit-optimize-contrast !important;"></canvas>
</code></p>

<p><em>Currently having some issues displaying this in all browsers. If anyone can shed some light on this I&#39;d be most appreciative</em></p>

<p>Pi is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi">enigmatic concept</a>. On the one hand we can look at it simply as the ratio between the diameter of a circle and its circumference. On the other its an infinitely long number that, if proven to be randomly distributed, theoreticallys contain <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/216343/does-pi-contain-all-possible-number-combinations">all possible information in the universe</a>. For the purposes of this hack I decided to choose the former interpretation.</p>

<p>To begin with I generated a long string of Pi digits using <a href="http://www.craig-wood.com/nick/articles/pi-machin/">Machin&#39;s formula</a>. Fortunately, I could pull the bulk of the implementation from this <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/rmi/client.html">tutorial</a>. I then displayed these digits as circles of varying size distributed on the surface of a sphere. This was simply a matter of plotting spherical polar coordinates in 3D space. Finally, I used panned the camera angle to give the appearance of movement.</p>

<p>Main Lesson learnt; <strong>Processing Is A Bit Pants</strong>. There is no easy way to debug you program. Switching between Processing and ProcessingJS results in various parts breaking. Don&#39;t ge me wrong, it allowed me to get up and running very fast. I am happy with the end result, however, in future I will probably first attempt to use a modern language such as Python.</p>

	<h2>Hello World</h2>
	</a>
<div>06-06-2013</div>
<p><p>This is my first post on my brand new blog. It&#39;s been 3 years since I last attempted to publish anything on the web. For a while at least, the writing here will be confusing and at best awkward. Bear with me.</p>

<p>I created this blog as an outlet for my ideas and projects. I&#39;m a firm believer in the importance of putting what you create into the world. Without the fear of scrutiny our creations rarely receive the attention they need to fulfill their ambition. It also serves as a convenient stopping point from all the tweaking.</p>

<p>At the moment I&#39;ve been learning to code. Simple things. My goal is not to become a paid developer. I did that once. I wasn&#39;t very good. This time around I want to get a better understanding of how digital products are built. Hopefully these skills will enhance my design work, let me build some fun hacks and at the very least look less gormless when someone starts talking about the DOM or Backbone.</p>

<p>The first project I have to showcase is this blog. I built this using the wonderfully light weight <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/">Jekyll-Bootstrap</a> framework hosted on <a href="http://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>. It was a bit tricky getting everything set up but the tutorials made it relatively painfree.</p>

<p>Rather than use a template as a starting point, I decided to code the html and css from scratch. I also set myself the additional challenge of making it a responsive site so that it works across different devices. The tutorials at <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a> made is really straight forward even if the style of video made me cringe.</p>

<p>In addition, I got to grips with using <a href="http:/github.com">Github</a> for my version control and used <a href="http://icomoon.io/">IcoMoon</a> to create the font icons in the top bar.</p>

<p>Whilst it&#39;s not the most inventive design I&#39;m pretty satisfied with what I&#39;m starting with. There will be ongoing improvements as I test different approaches and techniques.</p>
